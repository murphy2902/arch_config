Someday I will set this up with a makefile and everything.  For now, make sure you configure your system to work with the files.  Some of them are tricky.  The only two files you need in ~/ are .zprofile, .bash_profile, and .xinitrc.  I'll add notes someday too ;)

TODO:

Makefile to put everything in it's place
	check for device names, such as wlo1 v wlp2s0, bat0 v bat1, etc
make a sh directory to put all overlapping code between bash and zsh, for compatability.
	make sure that it works with other shells too, shell ambiguous
Add a vlc small video command to i3
	sticky and send to top corner
	force small size
	auto open movie dialogue
